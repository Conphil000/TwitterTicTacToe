# TwitterTicTacToe

Repository dedicated specifically to the TicTacToe Project.

I will be using Tweepy to interact with users on Twitter. If a valid player responds with a valid number a game of TicTacToe will commence.

Operate under the assumption that SQL data will be stored by sending a JSON format to a service.

This SQL JSON Structure will follow these guidelines: 

'''
{
  'DB':'NAMEOFTABLE',
  'PAYLOAD':
    {
    'COLUMN':'VALUE',
    'COLUMN1':'VALUE1'
  }
}
